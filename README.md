# Machine-Learning
Machine Learning projects including Logistic Regression, Neural Network, Random Forest, SVM, etc.

**Neural Network with _Titanic_ Data**.  
Clean the data:   
Exclude the _PassengerId_, _Name_, _Ticket_, and _Cabin_ in the ensuing analysis.  
Delete missing values.  
Divide the cleaned data into 75% training and 25% testing.  
Classification:  
Build the best classifier to predict passenger survival using the training data and the Perceptron model with no hidden layer.  
Build the best classifier to predict passenger survival using the training data and the Perceptron model with 1 hidden layer with 3 neurons.  
Compare the performance in test data between different ckassifiers.
