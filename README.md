# Machine-Learning
Machine Learning projects including Logistic Regression, Neural Network, Random Forest, SVM, etc.

Neural Network with Titanic data.
Clean the data: exclude the PassengerId, Name, Ticket, and Cabin ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103801837/163736382-aed38c55-8393-42ce-b79c-a391ee5b8bb0.png)

Divide the cleaned data into 75% training and 25% testing.
Build the best classifier to predict passenger survival using the training data and the Perceptron model with no hidden layer.
Build the best classifier to predict passenger survival using the training data and the Perceptron model with 1 hidden layer with 3 neurons.
